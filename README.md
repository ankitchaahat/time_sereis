#   USING PROPHET 

Import Libraries:

Libraries like pandas, numpy, plotly, sklearn, matplotlib, and prophet are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
Load Training Data:

Training data is loaded from a CSV file into a DataFrame named training_data.
Display Basic Information:

The starting and ending dates of the training data are printed.
Data Preprocessing:

The dataPreprocessing function is defined to:
Convert the date column to datetime format.
Add hours from the hour column to the date column.
Drop the hour column.
The dataPreprocessing function is applied to the training data.
Visualize Training Data:

A line plot of the demand over time is created using Plotly Express.
Split Data into Training and Validation Sets:

The training data is split into training and validation sets (80% and 20% respectively).
Reset Index:

The index of both the training and validation data is reset.
Fit Prophet Model:

The Prophet model is instantiated and fitted on the training data.
Make Predictions:

Predictions are made on the validation data using the fitted model.
Visualize Predictions:

Plots are created to compare actual values and predictions, including confidence intervals for predictions.
The comparison is shown using matplotlib.
Evaluate Model Performance:

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated between actual and predicted values.
Install Plotly:

Plotly is installed if it's not already available.
Visualize Actual vs Predicted Targets Using Plotly:

Plotly is used to create an interactive plot comparing actual targets and predicted targets.
Load and Preprocess Test Data:

Test data is loaded and preprocessed similarly to the training data.
Make Predictions on Test Data:

Predictions are made on the test data and added to the test data DataFrame.
Save Results:

The test data with predictions is saved to a CSV file named submission.csv.
